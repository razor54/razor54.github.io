            Senior Software Engineer with a focus on DevOps. I started as a full-stack developer
            and have spent the last several years working on infrastructure automation, CI/CD, and
            cloud-native systems.

           I love building things. While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle,
           I'm most attracted to solving real customer problems with a clear business justification.
